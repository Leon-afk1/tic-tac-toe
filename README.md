# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python with Pygame

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python using the Pygame library for the graphical interface.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (install with `pip install pygame`)

## How to Play
1. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file to start the game.
2. Click on an empty cell to place your symbol (X or O).
3. The game will automatically alternate between player and computer turns.
4. The game will display the result (win, draw), waiting for a click to restart after the game ends.

## Features
- Simple graphical interface with Pygame.
- Automatic alternating between player and computer turns.
- Basic implementation of the Minimax algorithm for the computer.

## Project Structure
- `tic_tac_toe.py`: The main file containing the game class.
- `croix.png`: Image of the X symbol.
- `cercle.png`: Image of the O symbol.
- `OIP.jpeg`: Background image for the game window.
- `barre_hori.png` `barre_verti.png` `barre_diag_droite.png` and `barre_diag_gauche.png`: Line for the win

## Notes
This project is intended for my personal purposes to help me understand the implementation of Pygame and the Minimax algorithm. Feel free to enhance and customize it according to your needs.
